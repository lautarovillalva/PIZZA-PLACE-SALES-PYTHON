# Pizza Place Sales
A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

## Recommended Analysis

* How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
* How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
* How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
* Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?
